# Radio Chat

# Purpose
I want to expand my software development skills specifically to better understand TCP/IP, HTTP, Sockets, webRTC, and Web Sockets. I aim to create a Broadcast type application written in Rust using react for the UI. Think of Twitch but only a live audio stream where users can listen in and send messages to the broadcaster.


## Server Tools
- Rust
- Tokio
- Actix
- SQLx

- Docker
- Postgres

## UI Tools
- React (web ui)
- Leptos/Qt (desktop) if possible
- Flutter/Java (Android UI) if possible
