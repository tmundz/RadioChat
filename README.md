# Radio Chat

# Purpose
I want to expand my software development skills specifically to better understand TCP/IP, HTTP, Sockets, and Web Sockets by using the lowest-level network options so that they are aware of the difficulties. I aim to create a discord-like chat application written in Rust; however.
